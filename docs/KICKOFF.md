# Kickoff — starting an implementation session

Copy one of the prompts below into a **fresh** Claude Code session (the repo is
cloned fresh per session). The prompts in `prompts/queued/` are self-contained;
`docs/PROTOCOL.md` tells the session how to pick up and deliver the work.

## Default: implement the next queued prompt

```
Read docs/PROTOCOL.md and follow it. Implement the lowest-numbered prompt
in prompts/queued/. Do not start any other prompt in this session.
```

## Specific prompt (run out of order)

```
Read docs/PROTOCOL.md and follow it. Implement prompts/queued/<NNNN-name>.md.
Do not start any other prompt in this session.
```

## Rules of thumb

- **One session = one prompt = one PR.** Start a fresh session for each queued
  prompt. The session ends when its PR is merged (see `docs/PROTOCOL.md`).
- **Respect dependencies / ordering.** Prompts are numbered in implementation
  order and later ones assume earlier ones are merged (e.g. 0002 needs 0001).
  A fresh session branches off `main`, so it only sees **merged** work — kick off
  the next prompt after the previous PR merges. Only run prompts in parallel when
  they genuinely don't depend on each other.
- **Don't paste prompt bodies.** Point the session at the file in the repo so it
  reads the canonical version (numbers can change under the invariants in
  `docs/PROTOCOL.md` §6; the file is always current).
